# [Forecast](http://forecast.is)
Forecast is a website which tells you tomorrows weather forecast using GeoLocation to locate you.

It was created to demonstrate a use of Ligature asset fonts to represent words as a symbol. For example, the word “Cloudy” is represented as a cloud symbol.

## Usage
You will need to obtain an `API key` from [World Weather Online](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/register.aspx) in order to use their Weather API. Replace the string `API_KEY_HERE` in `assets/forecast.min` with your `API key`.

## Colophon
Forecast was lovingly made by [Josh Emerson](http://joshemerson.co.uk). I would like to thank the following people for providing fonts, icons and API's utilised by Forecast.
